# template-definitions

Template repository for entity definition libraries in Javascript

See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
for details on how to use this repository.

Included is a simple `template.py` analog to `cookiecutter` which will prompt
the user for some information and then write out templated values in select files.
After usage, the `template.py` file can be removed and the `README.md` and associated
`files` can be committed.
